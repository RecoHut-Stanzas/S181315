        "| Prblm Stmnt | The goal of session-based recommendation is to predict the next item(s) a user would likely choose to consume, given a sequence of previously consumed items in a session. Formally, we build a session-based model M(𝑠) that takes a session ⁍ for ⁍ as input and returns a list of top-𝑁 candidate items to be consumed as the next one ⁍. |\n",
        "| Solution | Firstly, we devise two linear models focusing on different properties of sessions: (i) Session-aware Linear Item Similarity (SLIS) model aims at better handling session consistency, and (ii) Session-aware Linear Item Transition (SLIT) model focuses more on sequential dependency. With both SLIS and SLIT, we relax the constraint to incorporate repeated items and introduce a weighting scheme to take the timeliness of sessions into account. Combining these two types of models, we then suggest a unified model, namely Session-aware Item Similarity/Transition (SLIST) model, which is a generalized solution to holistically cover various properties of sessions. |\n",
        "| Dataset | Yoochoose, Diginetica, RetailRocket, NowPlaying, and any session dataset in general |\n",
        "| Preprocessing | We discard the sessions having only one interaction and items appearing less than five times following the convention. We hold-out the sessions from the last 𝑁-days for test purposes and used the last 𝑁 days in the training set for the validation set. To evaluate session-based recommender models, we adopt the iterative revealing scheme, which iteratively exposes the item of a session to the model. Each item in the session is sequentially appended to the input of the model. Therefore, this scheme is useful for reflecting the sequential user behavior throughout a session. |\n",

        "Assume a user has visited the above five items in a e-commerce website consecutively. The first four will be used as the training data and our goal is to accurately predict the last item. It is not necessary for the user to log into the system and other auxiliary information may not be available as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommender systems help users find relevant items of interest, for example on e-commerce or media streaming sites. Most academic research is concerned with approaches that personalize the recommendations according to long-term user profiles. In many real-world applications, however, such long-term profiles often do not exist and recommendations, therefore, have to be made solely based on the observed behavior of a user during an ongoing session.\n",

        "### Characteristics of Session-based recommenders\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to the traditional ones, session-based recommender systems exhibit some unique characteristics. \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Session consistency: Firstly, the items observed in the same session are often highly coherent and consistent with the user’s specific intent, e.g., a list of products in the same category or a list of songs with a similar mood, referred to as **session consistency**.\n",
        "2. Sequential dependency: Secondly, some items tend to be consumed in a specific order, namely sequential dependency, e.g., consecutive episodes of a TV series.\n",
        "3. Repeated item consumption: Thirdly, the user might repeatedly consume the same items in a session, called repeated item consumption. For instance, the user may listen to her favorite songs repeatedly or choose the same smartphone for the comparisons.\n",
        "4. Timeliness of sessions: Lastly, recent sessions are generally a stronger indicator of the user’s interest, namely, timeliness of sessions. The above four properties do not necessarily appear in all sessions, and one property may be dominant than others.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Session Representations\n",
        "\n",
        "![Figure: An example of two session representations. In full session representation, all items in a session are related each other. In partial session representation, there are sequential correlations across items.](https://github.com/RecoHut-Stanzas/S181315/raw/main/images/img1.png)\n",

        "Figure: An example of two session representations. In full session representation, all items in a session are related each other. In partial session representation, there are sequential correlations across items.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Full session representation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The entire session is represented as a single vector. Specifically, a session $𝑠 = (𝑠_1,𝑠_2,\\dots,𝑠_{|𝑠|})$ is regarded as a set of items $𝑠 = \\{𝑠_1,𝑠_2,\\dots,𝑠_{|𝑠|}\\}$, ignoring the sequence of items. As depicted in the following figure, the number of training examples (𝑚) is equal to the number of sessions. It is more suitable for a case where items in a session tend to have a stronger correlation among them, relatively insensitive to the order of consumption. Note that the repeated items in the session are treated as a single item as the full session representation mainly handles the session consistency across items.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Partial session representation**\n",
        "\n",
        "A session is divided into two subsets, past and future, to represent the sequential correlations across items. For some time step 𝑡, the past set consists of items that have been consumed before 𝑡, i.e., $s_{1:𝑡−1} = \\{𝑠_1, \\dots, 𝑠_{𝑡−1}\\}$, and the future set consists of items consumed at or after 𝑡, i.e., $s_{𝑡:|𝑠 |} = \\{𝑠_𝑡 , \\dots, 𝑠_{|𝑠|}\\}$. We can produce |𝑠|−1 such partial sessions by taking each 𝑡 = 2, ..., |𝑠| as the threshold. By stacking |𝑠| −1 past and future set pairs for all sessions, we construct two matrices.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this model, we use a linear model using full session representation, focusing on the similarity between items. We reformulated the objective function of SLIM to accommodate the timeliness of sessions and repeated item consumption in the session.\n",

        "### Session-aware Linear Item Transition Model (SLIT)\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the partial session representation, we design a linear model that captures the sequential dependency across items. Unlike SLIS, each session is split into multiple partial sessions, forming different input and output matrices. Similar to SLIS, we also incorporate the weight of sessions to SLIT. Meanwhile, we ignore the constraint for diagonal elements as different input and output matrices are naturally free from the trivial solution.\n",
